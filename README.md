🧠 Cancer Predictor

Predict the likelihood of cancer using linear regression and real-world medical data. Built with Python, Scikit-learn, and Streamlit for an interactive, browser-based experience.

🔗 Live App: https://cancer-predictor-qr4zehvadpw7ado4yaud8n.streamlit.app/

🚀 Features
📊 Linear Regression Model trained on labeled medical data.

📈 Interactive visualizations using Plotly to display predictions and trends.

🧮 Real-time prediction based on user-input features.

⚙️ Built with Scikit-learn, NumPy, and pandas.

🖥️ Deployed with Streamlit for fast and accessible web app functionality.

📌 Technologies Used
Python 3.10+

Scikit-learn – model building and training

pandas / NumPy – data processing

Plotly – dynamic graphs and visualizations

Streamlit – front-end deployment

🛠️ How It Works
The user inputs values for key medical features (e.g., mean radius, texture, perimeter).

The model processes these inputs using a pre-trained Linear Regression algorithm.

The app predicts the cancer likelihood and visualizes the result with a plotted output.
